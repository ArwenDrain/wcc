        Lise Meitner, an Austrian physicist, collabortated with Otto Hahn in their work on radioactive elements and nuclear physics.When Hahn discovered that uranium atoms were split when bombarded with neutrons, Meitner then calculated the energy released in the reaction and named the phenomenon "nuclear fission." This discovery would eventually lead to the atomic bomb.
